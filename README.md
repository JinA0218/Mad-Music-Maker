1. **Basic Settings**  
   - **Note Length**: Defines note duration (number of vertical grid cells). Default = 1.  
   - **Note Type**: Instrument type. Available options: `sine, square, triangle, saw, synth1, synth2, kick, snare` (8 total).  

2. **Piano Roll**  
   - Horizontal axis = time, vertical axis = pitch.  
   - Default size: 32 cells (2 measures).  
   - Range: C4 (middle C) to C6.  
   - Clicking a cell places a note of the chosen length; clicking again removes it.  

3. **Score (Notation)**  
   - Generates sheet music using **ABC notation** (A–G representation).  

4. **Controls**  
   - **← Button**: Returns to the previous screen and adds the score to the workspace.  
   - **+ Button (top-right)**: Extends piano roll length by 16 cells, allowing longer compositions.  

By repeating these steps, users can complete a composition and view the score by instrument:

### 3) Audio Generation

The server converts score data into audio files.  

1. Generates a **WAV file** and writes header information.  
2. Processes each note based on pitch and selected instrument, using appropriate waveform functions.  
3. Combines and outputs the final WAV file back to the client.
